# Sign in with Solana

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Advanced", "Solana" ]} />

## Overview

The `ic-siws` (SIWS) project provides ICP dapps with a way to enable Solana-based authentication. The project's goal is to enhance the interoperability between ICP and Solana by enabling developers to build dapps that can use both chains.

The [`ic-siwe` (SIWE)](siwe.mdx) project is also available for enabling Ethereum-based authentication.

You can try the deployed demo here: https://guidq-3qaaa-aaaal-qiteq-cai.icp0.io

### Key features

- **Solana Wallet Sign-In**: Enables any Solana wallet to generate an ICP identity and sign into ICP dapps.

- **Prebuilt identity solution**: Provides a prebuilt canister that can be integrated into any ICP project, independent of the project's programming language.

- **Direct Solana wallet address to `Principal` mapping**: Uses a 1:1 correlation between Solana addresses and `Principals`.

- **Consistent principal generation**: Ensures each Solana wallet produces the same `Principal`.

- **Session identity uniqueness**: Verifies that each session identity is specific to each application's context.

- **Timebound sessions**: Developers can set expiration times for sessions to enhance control and security.


## Usage

To use SIWS, developers have two possible workflows:

1. Use the prebuilt [ic_siws_provider](https://github.com/kristoferlund/ic-siws/tree/main/packages/ic_siws_provider)**: The pre-built identity provider canister can be integrated with any ICP project by adding the canister's information to the project's `dfx.json` file. When using the pre-built canister solution, the following login workflow is used:

- An ICP dapp requests a SIWS message on behalf of a user from the `ic_siws_provider` canister.

- The dapp displays the SIWS message to the user who must sign it with their Solana wallet.

- The dapp sends the signed SIWS message to the `ic_siws_provider` canister. The canister verifies the signature and creates an ICP Principal for the user.

- The dapp retrieves the Principal from the `ic_siws_provider` canister and can now use the new Principal to make authenticated calls for the user.

2. **Use the [ic_siws](https://crates.io/crates/ic_siws) Rust library directly**: Provides developers with full control over the SIWS integration through the `ic_swis` library.
