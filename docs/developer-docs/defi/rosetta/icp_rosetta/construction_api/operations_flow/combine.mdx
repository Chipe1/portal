# Construction-combine

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Tutorial" ]} />


## Overview
This section details how to call the `construction/combine` endpoint of the Rosetta construction API.
The request and response types can be found in the [official documentation](https://docs.cdp.coinbase.com/rosetta/reference/constructioncombine).

## Signing payloads
The payloads that one receives from the `construction/payloads` endpoint contain a hex string that needs to be signed with the private key of the `accountidentifier` that is associated with the hex string. 
Here is an example of such a payload:

```json
{"account_identifier":{"address":"8b84c3a3529d02a9decb5b1a27e7c8d886e17e07ea0a538269697ef09c2a27b4"},"hex_bytes":"0a69632d72657175657374df3e33267733b2030e8a4fc1d7eb6e0884ab461806630921a9c0c9749abb99de","signature_type":"ecdsa"}
```

This means that we need to sign the hex bytes `0a69632d72657175657374df3e33267733b2030e8a4fc1d7eb6e0884ab461806630921a9c0c9749abb99de` with the private key associated with the accountidentifier 
`8b84c3a3529d02a9decb5b1a27e7c8d886e17e07ea0a538269697ef09c2a27b4` using an `ecdsa` signature type.
