# Overview

<MarkdownChipRow labels={["Intermediate", "Governance", "Concept"]} />

A proposal is a suggestion for a change to the Internet Computer protocol. The NNS is an open governance system where anyone can become a participant. NNS DAO participants can submit proposals, make suggestions on how the ICP should evolve, and vote on proposals that others have submitted.

Based on the majority decision, a proposal is then adopted or rejected. If a proposal is adopted, it is automatically executed fully on-chain, without the need for manual intervention.

More technically, to participate in the NNS governance, users can stake some ICP tokens in a neuron. At least 1 ICP are required to create a neuron.

If a neuron has more than 6 months dissolve delay, it is eligible to participate in voting. This means that it can both submit and vote on proposals.
